Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The main types of machine learning are 1. Supervised Learning Learning with labeled data 2. Unsupervised Learning Learning with unlabeled data 3. Reinforcement Learning Learning through rewards and punishments Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
